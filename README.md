Brief
=====
Friendly C++ build system which doesn't follow trends.

Motivation
==========
Pake is trying to address lack of good alternative for plain make when it comes to C++ development. Although there is a cmake, qmake and bunch of other projects, either provided painless project management so I decided to give a shot in implementing my own vision of how build system should be usable.
